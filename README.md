## **Additional Recommendations**

### **1. Review and Adjust Indicators**

- **Indicator Periods**: Ensure that the indicator periods are appropriate for daily data.
- **Additional Indicators**: Consider incorporating fundamental analysis or sentiment analysis for long-term strategies.

### **2. Monitor Market Conditions**

- **Economic Events**: Be aware of major economic events or news that could impact the cryptocurrency market.
- **Market Trends**: Long-term trading requires understanding broader market trends.

### **3. Regularly Reassess the Strategy**

- **Backtesting**: Continuously backtest the strategy with new data to ensure its effectiveness.
- **Optimization**: Adjust parameters based on backtesting results to optimize performance.

### **4. Implement Order Execution Checks**

- **Order Status**: After placing orders, check if they are filled before proceeding.
- **Partial Fills**: Handle scenarios where orders are partially filled.

### **5. Use a Scheduler**

- Instead of using `time.sleep()`, consider using a scheduling library like `APScheduler` or `schedule` to run the bot at specific times.

```python
import schedule
import time

def main():
    # Your trading logic here

schedule.every().day.at("00:00").do(main)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
